        <p>Like all living things, trees have a natural lifespan. A tree's lifespan can be cut short when natural events damage the tree and a full removal is the safest option. Dead or dying trees should be attended to as soon as possible to determine if they should be cut down. Problems to look for are cracks, seams, dead branches, rot and decay.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cell small-12 medium-6">
        <p>There are also times when the tree is not suitable for the area it is in. If the tree is in an area that poses a risk, it may need to be taken down despite of its health.</p>

      <div class="cell small-12 medium-6">
        <p>Deciding whether or not to remove a tree can be a tough decision. We can help you make that decision. With years of experience, we can assess if a removal is necessary to protect your family and property, or if another option is available. We want to help. Our skilled climber and feller can remove a tree in even the tightest spots.</p>

        <p>Tree trimming is a broad category that is known by several other names: thinning, pruning, wind sailing, deadwooding, balancing, shaping, etc. While tree trimming has many names, the goal is the same, to make your trees safe, healthy and last for years to come. In the Pacific Northwest, trees can quickly become overgrown, unhealthy or too dense. All of these can make a tree harder to maintain and keep healthy and can decrease the aesthetic value of your property. Trees, like other plants, if not maintained, can get a bit out of control.</p>

        <p>A properly pruned tree is a thing of beauty. While different species of tree have similarities in the way that they are pruned, every tree and situation is unique. We will meet with you and individually evaluate each tree. Then, after we have talked about the health of the tree and all of your options, we will make a plan and get movinâ€™. We utilize the latest and safest roping techniques as safety and quality are our top priorities.</p>
